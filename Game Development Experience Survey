Hey, I'm SD. I am a high school senior taking English Comp 102. My research is on game development. The goals of the research is to find how a game developer's perspective can help their team advance, how cooperations between game organizations/projects can give advantages, and why does receiving feedback from multiple sources and interactions with customers help lead to success in this process. So I'm reaching out to various game developers to ask if they can take a 10-question survey on this matter. It should only take a couple of minutes. The results will be anonymous and the findings would only be shared with my teacher and class. Taking this would be really appreciated! Let me know if you have any questions.
